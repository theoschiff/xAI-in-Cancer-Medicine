The SHAP values reveal key genetic features impacting the predicted Area Above the Curve (AAC) for erlotinib response.

- **TLE5 (SHAP: -0.00262835):** Negative contribution, indicating its low expression (7.49116) may be associated with reduced drug sensitivity.
- **PSPN (SHAP: -0.00237645):** Negative contribution, suggesting its low expression (9.50409) could be linked to decreased tumor response.
- **UBE2M (SHAP: -0.00230246):** Negative contribution, implying its low expression (3.60056) may influence the drug response in a similar manner to PSPN.
- **PLEKHJ1 (SHAP: -0.00199659):** Negative contribution, indicating its low expression (5.4724) could be related to reduced drug efficacy.

In summary, the identified features suggest that low expression of TLE5, PSPN, UBE2M, and PLEKHJ1 may be associated with reduced erlotinib response, warranting further investigation into their potential as biomarkers for personalized medicine.
