The SHAP values reveal key genetic features impacting the predicted Area Above the Curve (AAC) for erlotinib response.

- **SOX15 (SHAP: 0.00833636):** Moderate positive contribution, indicating its expression level (6.25921) may influence the drug's efficacy in modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a key pathway in cancer cell proliferation.
- **UGT1A3 (SHAP: 0.00741029):** Slight positive effect, suggesting its expression level (2.25366) may impact the drug's pharmacokinetics, potentially affecting its bioavailability and efficacy.
- **TRIM29 (SHAP: 0.00673423):** Minor positive impact, reflecting its limited involvement in the regulation of cellular stress responses and apoptosis, which may influence the drug's ability to induce cancer cell death.
- **MICALL1 (SHAP: 0.00646013):** Slight positive contribution, indicating its expression level (18.4582) may play a role in modulating the cell cycle and apoptosis, potentially influencing the drug's efficacy in cancer treatment.
