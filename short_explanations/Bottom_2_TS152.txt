The SHAP values reveal key genetic features impacting the predicted Area Above the Curve (AAC) for erlotinib response.

- **LIN54 (SHAP: -0.00277591):** Negative contribution, indicating its low expression (7.59) may be associated with reduced drug efficacy.
- **SIRT6 (SHAP: -0.00225572):** Slightly negative effect, suggesting its low expression (4.20) could influence decreased drug response.
- **BTBD1 (SHAP: -0.00221959):** Minimal negative impact, reflecting its moderate expression (6.10) has a limited effect on drug sensitivity.
- **CENPL (SHAP: -0.00197824):** Slight negative influence, indicating its low expression (7.10) may marginally lower the AAC.
