The SHAP values reveal key genetic features impacting the predicted Area Above the Curve (AAC) for erlotinib response.

- **UBE2M (SHAP: -0.0031394):** Negative contribution, indicating its low expression (3.88) may be associated with reduced drug efficacy, potentially influencing the tumor's response to erlotinib.
- **SYNJ1 (SHAP: -0.00190584):** Slight negative effect, suggesting its low expression (9.19) may marginally impact the drug's effectiveness.
- **DONSON (SHAP: -0.001572):** Minor negative influence, reflecting its low expression (6.77) may have a limited impact on the AAC.
- **GADD45GIP1 (SHAP: -0.00128787):** Slight negative effect, indicating its low expression (5.79) may contribute to reduced drug response.

In summary, the identified features suggest that low expression of UBE2M, SYNJ1, DONSON, and GADD45GIP1 may be associated with reduced erlotinib efficacy, warranting further investigation into their potential as biomarkers for personalized treatment strategies.
