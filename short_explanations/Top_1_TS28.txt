The SHAP values reveal key genetic features impacting the predicted Area Above the Curve (AAC) for erlotinib response.

- **AC011473.4 (SHAP: 0.090653):** Strong positive contribution, suggesting its high expression (80.8526) plays a key role in drug sensitivity, potentially indicating a favorable response to erlotinib.
- **KLK7 (SHAP: 0.0347236):** Moderate positive effect, with elevated expression (22.0465) potentially influencing tumor response, suggesting a possible synergistic interaction with erlotinib.
- **GJB3 (SHAP: 0.00384216):** Minor positive impact, reflecting limited involvement, and its expression (7.00119) may not significantly influence the AAC.
- **DPYSL2 (SHAP: -0.00215775):** Slight negative influence, suggesting reduced expression (5.8528) marginally lowers the AAC, indicating a potential antagonist effect on erlotinib response.

In summary, AC011473.4 is the most critical feature, highlighting its biomarker potential, and its high expression is strongly associated with a favorable response to erlotinib.
